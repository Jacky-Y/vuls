"Behinder is a webshell management tool, consisting of shell code and a client. After uploading the client to a website, you can connect through it to obtain webshell access. For demonstration purposes, we are using it here. The download link for Behinder is https://github.com/rebeyond/Behinder/releases (other webshells operate similarly).

## 1 First, compress the shell into a zip file.

## 4 However, the shell is not deleted and the shell is stored in the website directory at /wp-content/upgrade/shell/shell.php.
