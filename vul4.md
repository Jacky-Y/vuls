"Behinder is a webshell management tool, consisting of shell code and a client. After uploading the client to a website, you can connect through it to obtain webshell access. For demonstration purposes, we are using it here. The download link for Behinder is https://github.com/rebeyond/Behinder/releases (other webshells operate similarly).

##1 First, compress the shell into a zip file.
##2 Upload the zip file through the plugin upload feature.
##3 WordPress indicates a plugin installation failure.
##4 The shell is stored in the website directory at /wp-content/upgrade/shell/shell.php.
##5 Using the Behinder client to connect to the shell, a successful connection grants webshell access."
